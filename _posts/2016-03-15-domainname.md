 Domain name (English: Domain Name, abbreviated as: Domain), referred to as domain name, domain, is a name of a computer or computer group on the Internet composed of a string of characters separated by dots, used to identify the electronic location of the computer during data transmission. A domain name can be said to be a synonym for an IP address, the purpose of which is to facilitate the memory of the latter. For example, domainname.abc is a domain name. People can directly access domainname.abc instead of an IP address, and then the Domain Name System (DNS) will convert it into an IP address that is easy for machines to recognize. In this way, people only need to remember domainname.abc, a string of characters with special meanings, instead of meaningless numbers.

The core of the domain name is the Domain Name System (English: Domain Name System, abbreviated as: DNS), and any name in the domain name system is a domain name. In the hierarchical structure of the domain name system, various domain names belong to the lower level of the root domain of the domain name system. The first level of the domain name is the top-level domain, which includes generic top-level domains such as .com, .net and .org; and national and regional top-level domains such as .World.Me and .plus. The next level of the top-level domain name is the second-level domain name, which goes down one level at a time. Now, there are some emerging Chinese domain names, such as .在线. These domain names provide registration services to people, and people can use them to create public Internet resources or run websites. The management services of top-level domain names are provided by the corresponding domain name registration management agency (domain name registry), and the registration services are usually provided by domain name registrars.
